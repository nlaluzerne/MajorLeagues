I think that feature engineering could help establish additional value using exploratory data analysis in this
data set in a number of ways.
    1.  The Product_Code, Warehouse, and Product_Category columns can be transformed from strings to numeric ids.
        Time series forecasting models often can't deal with strings, so transforming the strings to numeric ids
        will allow these columns to be easily modeled by a time series forecasting scheme.
    2.  The date column in the form YYYY/MM/DD (a string) can be transformed into three separate numerical columns,
        one for the year, one for the month, and one for the day. Also, the day can be omitted since different months
        have different numbers of days - this "confuses" forecasting and can introduce bias. Year isn't always the
        greatest feature either, but I will leave it in to keep as much data as possible. I can also see a situation
        where product demand changes over the years, so this could be a helpful field. Moreover, the new year column
        should be scaled such that the first year in the data set is either 0 or 1, and the rest of  the years follow
        the numerical sequence. This is so that the forecaster is not biased by large numbers which don't actually
        represent a large number.
